PLASMA requires the following software packages to be installed in the system prior to PLASMA's installation:
BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK and Netlib LAPACK C Wrapper.

To add any user defined subroutine in PLASMA it has to be declared inside BLAS or LAPACK first. As PLASMA is built over 
BLAS and LAPACK therefore PLASMA subroutines internally call BLAS and LAPACK C Wrappers

                           Adding Subroutines in BLAS								  //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To add any user defined subroutine in BLAS just add that subroutine in BLAS directory and modify the Makefile by adding the 
function name in source list. Now to compile run make it will create an executable with an ".o" extension in the BLAS directory.

To check functioning of user defined BLAS subroutine create a wrapper in "src/" directory of cblas and define those wrappers in 
the file "cblas.h" and "cblas_f77.h" inside the "include/" directory of cblas. Modify the Makefile in "src/" directory by adding 
the user defined wrapper name in source list. 
Please note that one has to link the archive file of modified BLAS library correctly in "Makefile.in" inside the main folder of 
cblas.
Now to test the subroutines one can write their own examples by looking at the samples inside "example/" directory.

                           Adding Subroutines in LAPCK								  //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

To add any user defined subroutine in LAPACK just add that subroutine in "SRC" directory and modify the Makefile by adding the 
function name in source list. Now to compile run make it will create an executable with an ".o" extension in the SRC directory.

To check functioning of user defined LAPACK subroutine create two wrapper files "lapacke_functionname.c" and "lapacke_functionname_work.c"  
in "src/" directory of "lapcke" folder which is the c wrapper for LAPACK . Now define those wrappers in the file "lapacke.h" inside the 
"include/" directory of "lapacke" folder. Modify the Makefile in "src/" directory by adding the user defined wrapper name in source list. 

Please note that if the user is compiling LAPCK using modified BLAS then the user has to link the archive file of modified BLAS library 
and CBLAS library correctly in "make.inc" inside the main folder of LAPACK.
Now to test the subroutines one can write their own examples by looking at the samples inside "example/" directory of "lapacke" folder.
