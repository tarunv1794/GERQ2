To add any user defined subroutine in MAGMA it has to be declared inside "magmablas" or "src" directory first.
Steps to add subroutine inside MAGMA:
1. Add any user defined function in "magmablas" or "src"
2. Include the file name in the list in Makefile.src
3. If the user is adding any subroutines of BLAS such as GEMV or GEMM then add function declarations inside
   "*magmablas_x_q.h" and "*magmablas_x_v1.h" inside "include" directory. Now assign the function declaration
   of "*magmablas_x_q.h" to "*magmablas_x_v1.h" inside "magmablas_x_v2.h" in "include" directory. 
4. If user is adding any subroutine other than BLAS then user has to add function definition in "*magma_x.h" in "include" directory.
5. Now users can test the subroutines by writing their own testing examples with the help of other testing subroutines inside "testing/" directory.
6. Now run "make".

Note: * x indicates type of variable the user is using for their subroutine. For example in case of Double Precision x is "d".
